# [300. Longest Increasing Subsequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-increasing-subsequence/)

- can't figure out how to solve this question with O(n log(n)) time complexity, so follow [solution 2](<https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-increasing-subsequence/discuss/1326308/C%2B%2BPython-DP-Binary-Search-BIT-Solutions-Picture-explain-O(NlogN)>) to solve this question.

- it seems using DP is another way to do this question.
