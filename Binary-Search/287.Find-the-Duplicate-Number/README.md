# [287. Find the Duplicate Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-duplicate-number/)

- The first solution using `Map` is an easy way to think about, but not conform to the question's requirement actually. (maybe using `Set` is a good way by the way)

- The second solution using `tortoise and hare racing` concept would be one of the best ways to solve this problem i think. But I spent much time to figure out how the concept work in array and the proof of the second phase.
